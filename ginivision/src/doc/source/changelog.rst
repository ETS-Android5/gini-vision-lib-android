2.0.0-stub.1 (2016-07-15)
=======================

Features
--------

- Stub version of the completely rewritten Gini Vision Library.
- Provides two integration options: 1) A Screen API that can be easily implemented using Activities. 2) A more complex but at the same time more flexible Component API using Fragments. 
- For the communication between your app and the Library use the `CameraActivity`, `ReviewActivity` and `AnalysisActivity` for the Screen API or implement the listener methods for the Fragments when using the Component API.
- This stub release implements all calls for the future 2.0.0 release. It allows the user to capture a simulated document and review it. Also screens for onboarding and further analysis are provided. For the final release the UI will be further improved and minor changes are made in the implementation if really necessary.
