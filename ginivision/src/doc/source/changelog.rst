2.0.0-stub.1 (2016-07-14)
=======================

Features
--------

- Stub version of the completely rewritten Gini Vision Library.
- Provides two integration options. An easy to implement Screen API using Activities and a more complex more flexible Component API using Fragments.
- For communication between your app and the Library use the `CameraActivity`, `ReviewActivity` and `AnalysisActivity` for the Screen API or implement the listener methods for the Fragments when using the Component API.
- This stub release implements all calls for the future 2.0.0 release. It allows a user to capture a document and review it. Also screens for onboarding and further analysis are provided. Until the final release the UI will be further improved and eventually minor changes are made to the implementations.
