<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Gini provides an information extraction system for analyzing documents (e. g. invoices or
contracts), specifically information such as the document sender or the amount to pay in an invoice.</p>
<p>The Gini Vision Library for Android provides functionality to capture documents with mobile phones.
The captured images can be reviewed and rotated to the correct orientation by the user and are optimized on the device
to provide the best results when used with the Gini API.</p>

<h4>2.1.0 (2017-01-30)<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Removed the 4:3 aspect ratio requirement for photos. The default camera aspect ratio will be used from now on. An 8MP minimum resolution is still required.</li>
<li>Removed the continuous-focus mode requirement. Only auto-focus is required.</li>
<li>If no continuous-focus mode is available then an auto-focus run is triggered when the user activates the capture button.</li>
<li>Trigger button is aligned to the bottom of the preview area.</li>
<li>The back button in the ReviewActivity and AnalysisActivity (in the navigation bar and in the ActionBar) leads back to the previous Activity instead of closing the library. The previous behavior can be requested by setting the <cite>CameraActivity#EXTRA_IN_BACK_BUTTON_SHOULD_CLOSE_LIBRARY</cite> to <cite>true</cite>.</li>

<h5>Features<a class="headerlink" href="#features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Feature complete version.</li>
<li>Using the Screen API a picture can be taken with the <cite>CameraActivity</cite>. It can be reviewed with the <cite>ReviewActvitiy</cite> with the possibility to start document analysis. If the document analysis didn&#8217;t complete or the document was rotated the document analysis can be continued or started again in the <cite>AnalysisActivity</cite>.</li>
<li>Using the Component API a picture can be taken with one of the Camera Fragments. Showing the picture with one of the Review Fragments allows review and rotation of the picture. You could also start the document analysis when showing one of the Review Fragments. If the document analysis didn&#8217;t complete or the document was rotated you should show one of the Analysis Fragments and continue or restart the document analysis.</li>

<h5>Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>

<li>Stub version of the completely rewritten Gini Vision Library.</li>
<li>Provides two integration options: 1) A Screen API that can be easily implemented using Activities. 2) A more complex but at the same time more flexible Component API using Fragments.</li>
<li>For the communication between your app and the Library use the <cite>CameraActivity</cite>, <cite>ReviewActivity</cite> and <cite>AnalysisActivity</cite> for the Screen API or implement the listener methods for the Fragments when using the Component API.</li>
<li>This stub release implements all calls for the future 2.0.0 release. It allows the user to capture a simulated document and review it. Also screens for onboarding and further analysis are provided. For the final release the UI will be further improved and minor changes are made in the implementation if really necessary.</li>

       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
